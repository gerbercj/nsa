# General Questions
## Are the objectives interesting to the target audience? 
Yes, very interesting.

## Is the scope of the project appropriate? If not, suggest improvements.
Seems to be a good scope for two people, some animation like adding a play button to play the change over a day can be added to just make it fuller. 

## Is the split between optional and must-have features appropriate? Why?
I think they have a very good split.

## Is the visualization innovative? Creative? Why?
The visualization is very innovative, It is very creative to using the polar chart to show time line.

## Does the visualization scale to the used dataset? Could it handle larger but similar datasets?  
Using only one day of data does not represents the statistics, it describes what happened on that day. It could be misleading to the user if there is not clear indication about the dataset. This could be solved by either aggregating data from many days or give the user a clarification about this visualization is only a snapshot instead of statistical.

# Visual Encoding

## Does the visualization follow the principles used in class? 
Yes. Overview (map), then drill down to the detail by polar chart and time selectors.

## What is the primary visual encoding? Does it match to the most important aspect of the data?
Location and colors are used as primary visual encoding. We suggest to view this visualization in grayscale to see if it will work well for color-disabled audience.

## What other visual variables are used? Are they effective?

## Is color sensibly used? If not, suggest improvements.
Red is a good color for indicating something not safe, it is sensibly used.

# Interaction and Animation.

## Is the interaction meaningful? If not, suggest improvements.
The interactions are very meaningful.

## If multiple views, are they coordinated? If not, would it be meaningful?
Multiple views are coordinated. One things could be an issue is that GMT time used for the polar chart. The scale of the visualization could be the world, the GMT time doesn't indicate local business hours of different locations obviously. It could be improved by converting the time to local time.

## Is there any animation planned? Is it clear? Is it intuitive? 
The animation of the visualization is very clear and intuitive.
